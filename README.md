Project Documentation: Review System and Admin Panel
Description
This project is a review system based on React, where users can leave reviews with ratings from 1 to 5 stars, and administrators can manage these reviews (including deleting them). The project uses several external libraries for styling, routing, and server communication, as well as for working with icons.

Libraries Used
The project uses the following libraries and tools:

React – for building the user interface.
React Router (react-router-dom) – for routing between pages.
Axios – for making HTTP requests to the server.
Styled-components – for styling components using CSS-in-JS.
FontAwesome (@fortawesome/fontawesome-free) – for adding icons to the application.
JSON Server (json-server) – for simulating a simple API to store reviews.
Installation of Dependencies
Create a React project: To create a React project, use the following command:

bash
npx create-react-app reviews-system
Install libraries for the frontend: After creating the project, install the necessary libraries:

bash

npm install axios react-router-dom styled-components @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
Install and set up JSON Server: JSON Server allows you to create a simple server to store reviews, which can be used as an API.

Install JSON Server globally:

bash
npm install -g json-server
In the root directory of the project, create a db.json file that will contain the data (for example, a list of users and reviews). Here's an example of the db.json file:

json

{
  "users": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "role": "user", "averageRating": 4.5 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "role": "admin", "averageRating": 4 }
  ],
  "reviews": [
    { "id": 1, "reviewerId": 1, "revieweeId": 2, "rating": 4, "comment": "Good user, recommend!" }
  ]
}
Start the JSON Server to simulate the API:

bash

json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
Now, your server will be available at http://localhost:3001.

API
The API for working with reviews is implemented using JSON Server. The server handles requests for getting, adding, and deleting reviews. All interactions with the server are done via Axios.

API Requests:
Get all reviews:

GET /reviews
Returns a list of all reviews.
Add a new review:

POST /reviews
Sends a new review with text and rating.
Delete a review:

DELETE /reviews/:id
Deletes a review by its identifier.
Here's an example of how to use the API with Axios in api.js:

javascript

import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3001',  // Using JSON Server
});

// Get all reviews
export const getReviews = async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/reviews');
  return response.data;
};

// Add a new review
export const addReview = async (reviewData) => {
  const response = await api.post('/reviews', reviewData);
  return response.data;
};

// Delete a review
export const deleteReview = async (id) => {
  const response = await api.delete(`/reviews/${id}`);
  return response.data;
};
Using FontAwesome for Icons
The FontAwesome library is used for adding icons to the project. After installing the @fortawesome/fontawesome-free package, you can import icons into your components.

Example of using icons:
jsx

import React from 'react';
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';
import { faStar } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

function Review({ text, rating }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{text}</p>
      <div>
        {Array(rating).fill().map((_, i) => (
          <FontAwesomeIcon key={i} icon={faStar} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Review;
In this example, the star icon is displayed based on the user's rating.

Styling with Styled-components
Styled-components is used for styling components directly in JavaScript.

Example of using styled-components:
jsx

import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
  }
`;

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Review System!</h1>
      <Button>Go to User Profile</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
Possible Improvements
Authentication and Authorization: Implement a login and registration system for users and administrators.
Expand Review Functionality: Add the ability to edit reviews and add filters by rating.
More complex rating system: Implement rating calculations based on more parameters.
Conclusion
This project provides a review management system with a simple server based on JSON Server. It also includes modern libraries for styling and animation, such as styled-components and FontAwesome. The project can be easily extended by adding new functionality and improving the styles.
